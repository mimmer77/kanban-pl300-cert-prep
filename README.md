Kanban Board for PL-300 Certification Prep
Welcome to my Kawaii Kanban Board, a tool to organize and track study tasks for the Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst (PL-300) certification! 🌟 This single HTML file solves the issue of Canva’s Kanban boards not saving progress by using localStorage for persistence.
Features

Five Columns: Organize tasks into “Prepare the Data,” “Visualize and Analyze Data,” “Manage and Secure Power BI,” “To Study,” and “Mastered.”
Drag-and-Drop: Move tasks (e.g., “DAX Calculations”) using SortableJS.
Checkboxes: Track sub-tasks (e.g., “Use CALCULATE function”).
Progress Bar: Shows 74h total study time and completion percentage.
Persistent Progress: Saves in your browser with localStorage.
Kawaii Aesthetic: Pastel gradient, Comic Sans MS, emojis (🌟).

Progress saves automatically in localStorage.
