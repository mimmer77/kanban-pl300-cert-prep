Kanban Board for PL-300 Certification Prep
Welcome to my Kawaii Kanban Board for preparing for the Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst (PL-300) certification! 🌟 This tool helps organize and track study progress for PL-300, built to overcome the limitation of Canva’s Kanban boards, which didn’t save progress. I created this with help from Grok while working through DataCamp courses like Trend Analysis, Time Series Analysis, and Financial Analysis in Power BI (aiming to complete by August 6, 2025, despite travel on July 24).
Features

Five Columns: Organize tasks into “Prepare the Data,” “Visualize and Analyze Data,” “Manage and Secure Power BI,” “To Study,” and “Mastered.”
Drag-and-Drop: Move tasks (e.g., “DAX Calculations”) between columns using SortableJS.
Checkboxes: Track sub-tasks (e.g., “Use CALCULATE function”) for granular progress.
Progress Bar: Displays 74h total study time and completion percentage based on sub-tasks.
Persistent Progress: Saves task positions and checkbox states in your browser using localStorage.
Kawaii Aesthetic: Pastel gradient, Comic Sans MS, and emojis (🌟) for a fun, engaging vibe.

Track Progress:

Why I Built This
While preparing for PL-300, I needed a reliable tool to track my DataCamp course progress (32% done with Trend Analysis, 50% with Baseball Data Visualization, etc.). Canva’s boards reset my progress, so I built this single HTML file with persistent storage and a fun kawaii aesthetic to keep me motivated!
